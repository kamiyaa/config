# Run the OnSongChange command when a new song starts playing.
# Specify the full path (i.e. no leading '~') of an executable to run.
# Arguments will be passed, and you can use the following escapes:

#     %a artist
#     %r album
#     %f filename
#     %t title
#     %n track
#     %d file duration in XX:YY form
